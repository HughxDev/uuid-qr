# Marlo Frontend Engineering Skills Interview

## Project Setup

Congratulations on making it to the skills interview for the Frontend Engineer position at Marlo! We use this part of the interview process to get an idea of how you'll work hands-on (without using a whiteboard).

Before you begin the project, here are a few things you’ll need to set up:

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marlo-interviews/interview-hguiney-wJDJ4udHP8RU5xFhU6LjIV2zXPM3ZBNJ.git
cd interview-hguiney-wJDJ4udHP8RU5xFhU6LjIV2zXPM3ZBNJ
```

### 2. Create a branch for your project

All work for the project should be done on a branch named `project`, and after completing your project, you'll create a pull request within Github to merge it to `master`.

```bash
git checkout -b project
```

### 3. Set up your project

1. You’ll need to use the create-react-app project to get started.

  1. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to set up.

  2. You’ll may interact with / include any node_modules you'd like in your project. Feel free to add them to your package.json.


### 4. Push your project setup to Github

Push your project setup to your private Marlo repo to make sure everything is working.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "project setup"
git push -u origin project
```

If you're reading this file, everything should be fine with permissions. But, if for some reason this doesn't work, let us know!

### 5. Prepare for your project

Once you start your project, you can use any additional libraries or resources you like as long as that resource does not solve the problem for you completely. 

### 6. Begin!
